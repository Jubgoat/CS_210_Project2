# CS_210_Project2
A project that I did in my CS class, it is a banking investment app that tracks monthly investments.

The following questions were asked in a prompt for my CS-210


    1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
        This app was was to track the initial investment of the user. It tracked monthly and yearly investments tracking the given interest rate. It displayed to the screen, the amount of the investment, how much was deposited every month, the annual interest rate, and how long it was invested for. It prompts the user as every step just decribed and then displays the information based on the user's information. 
    
    2. What did you do particularly well?
    
        I would say that I had followed the specifications really well and the organization of the code, in my opinion, looked very readable and organized.
    
    3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    
        I am not really sure how I would make it more secure at this moment as I think it is pretty secure based on my current knowledge. I would maybe get rid of some of the lines of comments and condense them to make the code as a whole easier to read, although it would not be as descriptive it would make it easier to edit and find where a problem might be. In my opinion too many comments makes it disorganized or harder to read and I think condensing them without leaving out important information would make it easier to read. 
    
    4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
        I think the InvestmentCalculator.cpp file was the hardest as it was the longest and there is generally more information in that class compared to the header or main (which was only 7 lines) 
    
    5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    
        I think learning how to make the app more secure was not only a learning process but something that would be very useful in the future projects for school and my career.
    
    6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

        I think spending more time in organizing the InvestmentCalculator.cpp class made it more readable and the comments afterwards made the code very descriptive. Getting the formulas of the calcualtions were the most important to code as a whole as it wouldn't do much wihtout it, I used for loops to process the calculations as to not write out too many lines.
